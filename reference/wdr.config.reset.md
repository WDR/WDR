Discards all configuration changes made in current WDR/wsadmin session.
Deletes temporary files and cleans configuration cache of the WDR/wsadmin session.

_It's a good practice to always explicitly save or discard configuration session before exiting the script, even if no changes have been made. Configuration sessions abandoned witout reset/discard/save leave temporary files and directories on the server._
